            <h1>Cell Theory</h1>
            <p>All living things are fundamentally made up of cells. An organism can be unicellular or multicellular. A single-celled organism can perform all the essential functions which enable it to grow, survive and reproduce while multicellular organisms are more complex in structure and function but the mechanism on how it can live is still the same with simple life forms.</p>

        <h1>Introduction of The Cell Theory</h1>
        <p>The cell theory, a cornerstone of modern biology, states that all living organisms are composed of cells, which are the fundamental structural and functional units of life.<br>The cell theory is universal for all living things, no matter how simple or complex, tiny or huge it is.</p>

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Hans and Zacharias Janssen in the years of 1590’s invented the compound microscope. Their invention has a great contribution in the discovery of cell and cell theory. In the year 1665, British scientist Robert Hooke coined the term ‘cell’ for the box-like structures he observed when viewing slice of cork through a microscope. In the year 1674 because of his invented microscope with improved lens, Anton van Leeuwenhoek was able to view living cells of algae spirogyra while examining his pond water. 
                    In the year 1838 the botanist and zoologist named Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann discovered that cells are the fundamental units of plants and animals. The discovery of the two leads to the conclusion that cells are the basic units of all living organisms. They have also proposed spontaneous generation or known as the abiogenesis as the method for cell origination, but it was later disproven. In the year 1855 a German Pathologist and Biologist named Rudolf Virchow famously stated the words “Omnis cellula e cellula” in German language, which means “the new cells come from already existing cells.”

                <h3>Personalities</h3>
                <p>• Zacharias Janssen and Hans Janssen are
                    	known for their invention of the compound optical microscope in 1590's. Their invention played a great role in the discovery of cell theory, making it easier and more practical when observing cells.
                    <br>•	Robert Hooke 
                    observed the remains of dead plant (cork) cells and coined the term "cellulae" or cell.
                    <br>•	Anton van Leeuwenhoek has
                    observed the living cells through his microscope that could magnify 270 to 300 times
                    <br>•	Matthias Jakob Schleiden is
                    	a German botanist in 1838, stated that cells are the building blocks of all plants.
                    <br>•	Theodor Schwann is
                    	a German physician and physiologist who added that cells are the fundamental units of animals in 1838.
                    <br>•	Rudolf Ludwig Carl Virchow 
                    stated 'Omnis cellula e cellula' which means that new cells come from already existing cells which is a postulate the cell theory.

                <h3>Impact on Science</h3>
                <p>It gave us an essential understanding of the building blocks of all living organisms, the discovery of the cell has led to advances in medical technology and treatment. 
                    <br><br>Personalized medicine, as scientists are working on today, would allow us to grow stem cells from our very own cells and then use them to understand disease processes. 
                    <br><br>All of this and more grew from a single observation of the cell in a cork.
